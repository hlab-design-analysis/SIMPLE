# SIMPLE
Code to simulate the fishes flow at landing in the small pelagic fishery and compare different sampling designs and estimators of the variance.

The current status of the simulator is shown below. For instance consider a (very small, for dev purpose) catch consisting of three hauls with different percentage of herring (0.1, 0.2, 0.3) and weight of the two species (50, 20, 60 kilograms respectively).
